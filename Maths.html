        <ul>
            <li><p align = "justify">Born in 476 CE, Aryabhata was one of the first major mathematicians and astronomers from ancient India.</li>
	    <li><p align = "justify"> He authored the famous work, "Aryabhatiya", which was composed when he was just 23 years old. </li>
        <h2><p align = "left">Contributions to Mathematics:</h2>
            <li><p align = "justify"><b>Place Value System and Zero:</b> Aryabhata used a place-value system with zero, which was a major breakthrough in mathematics.This system is the foundation of how we write numbers today.</li>
            <li><p align = "justify"><b>Approximation of Pi (π):</b> He calculated the value of pi (π) as approximately 3.1416, remarkably close to the true value.Pi is a very important number in geometry.</li>
            <li><p align = "justify"><b>Trigonometry:</b> Aryabhata also made significant contributions to trigonometry, which is the study of triangles.</li>
	<h2><p align = "left">Astronomical Achievements:</h2>
            <li><p align = "justify"><b>Eclipses:</b> Aryabhata provided a scientific explanation for solar and lunar eclipses, stating that they are caused by the shadows of the Earth and the Moon.</li>
            <li><p align = "justify"><b>Earth's Rotation:</b> He correctly stated that the Earth rotates on its axis, which causes day and night. This was a revolutionary idea at the time..</li>
        <h2><p align = "left">Legacy:</h2>
        <p align = "justify">Aryabhata's contributions laid the groundwork for future mathematicians and astronomers, both in India and across the world. In honor of his work, India's first satellite was named "Aryabhata".</ul>
